End-to-End Book Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a book recommendation system built using collaborative filtering techniques. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, building userâ€“item interaction models, training recommendation algorithms, and evaluating recommendation performance. Practical experiments and notebooks illustrate how collaborative filtering can be applied to generate personalized book recommendations.

(More details, usage instructions, datasets, and examples will be added by the repository owner later.)
